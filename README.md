# State-and-Parameter-Estimation-of-DC-DC-Converters-Based-on-The-Modified-Nonlinear-Model
### Description:
This project explores the state and parameter estimation of DC/DC converters based on a modified nonlinear model. The effectiveness of the Extended Kalman filter is examined for three different converter topologies: buck, boost, and buck-boost. Additionally, a generalized space state representation is considered, and the Extended Kalman filter is applied to analyze the results.The detailed research article for this project is available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373803659_State_and_Parameter_Estimation_of_DCDC_Converters_Based_on_The_Modified_Nonlinear_Model).

### Code:
The MATLAB code for implementing the nonlinear model and performing the Extended Kalman filter estimation is included in this GitHub repository.
